> **A Layer 3 blockchain implementing democratic governance principles inspired by constitutional frameworks**

Republic is a novel blockchain network that implements democratic and republican governance systems, drawing inspiration from constitutional principles, particularly the Constitution of India. Unlike traditional trust-based blockchain architectures, Republic introduces a governance-first approach to consensus and network operations.

## Overview

Republic aims to bridge the gap between real-world democratic institutions and blockchain technology by implementing:

- **Constitutional Governance**: Core principles derived from democratic constitutions
- **Republican Consensus**: Novel consensus mechanisms based on representative democracy rather than pure trust
- **Layer 3 Architecture**: Building upon proven foundations while introducing innovative governance layers
- **Real-world Abstractions**: Implementing concepts like term limits, representation, and accountability in a blockchain context

## Key Features

- üèõÔ∏è **Democratic Consensus**: BFT consensus with leader rotation and term limits
- üó≥Ô∏è **Representative Governance**: Stakeholder representation and voting mechanisms
- üìú **Constitutional Framework**: Immutable governance rules with amendment procedures
- üîó **Layer 3 Design**: Leveraging existing infrastructure while adding governance innovation
- üõ°Ô∏è **Accountability Mechanisms**: Built-in checks and balances for network participants

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 (Design & Specification)

The project is currently in the design and specification phase. Implementation will proceed through structured phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Single-node prototype with basic state machine
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-node devnet with consensus implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Hardening, optimization, and testnet launch
4. **Phase 4**: Governance mechanisms and tokenomics
5. **Phase 5**: Security audit and mainnet preparation

## Architecture

Republic follows a modular, pluggable architecture:

- **Account-based State Model**: Similar to Ethereum's account system
- **BFT Consensus**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus with democratic principles
- **P2P Gossip Network**: Decentralized communication layer
- **JSON-RPC Interface**: Standard blockchain interaction protocols
- **WASM Runtime**: Smart contract execution environment (future phases)
