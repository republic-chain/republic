# Security Model Research

This document outlines Republic's security research, examining how democratic governance principles affect traditional blockchain security assumptions and introducing novel security considerations for constitutional consensus systems.

!!! danger "Research Stage"
    Security models described here are under active research and not yet implemented. All security assumptions and threat models are preliminary and subject to change.

## Security Philosophy

Republic's security model goes beyond traditional blockchain security to include **Democratic Security** - protection not just of technical infrastructure, but of democratic institutions and governance processes themselves.

### Multi-layered Security Approach

1. **Cryptographic Security**: Traditional blockchain security properties
2. **Consensus Security**: Byzantine fault tolerance with democratic enhancements
3. **Governance Security**: Protection of democratic processes and institutions
4. **Constitutional Security**: Safeguarding the constitutional framework itself

## Traditional Security Properties

### Inherited Security Guarantees

Republic maintains standard blockchain security properties:

#### Immutability
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 for block and transaction integrity
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for transaction authentication
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient verification of large data sets
- **Chain Structure**: Tamper-evident sequential block linking

#### Availability
- **Distributed Architecture**: No single point of failure
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Operation with up to f malicious nodes
- **Network Redundancy**: Multiple communication paths
- **Data Replication**: Full state maintained across validators

#### Consistency
- **Deterministic Execution**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Total Ordering**: Global agreement on transaction sequence
- **Finality**: Irreversible confirmation of transactions
- **State Synchronization**: All nodes maintain identical state

## Enhanced Security Through Democracy

### Democratic Security Properties

Republic's democratic approach provides additional security guarantees:

#### Legitimacy-based Security
- **Community Validation**: Validators derive authority from community support
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Regular evaluation and potential removal
- **Transparency Requirements**: Public decision-making processes
- **Appeal Procedures**: Democratic recourse for disputed decisions

#### Representation-based Protection
- **Geographic Distribution**: Resistance to localized attacks
- **Stakeholder Diversity**: Protection against single-interest capture
- **Term Rotation**: Prevention of long-term entrenchment
- **Constitutional Bounds**: Limits on validator authority

#### Collective Intelligence Security
- **Distributed Decision Making**: No single point of control
- **Peer Review**: Validator decisions subject to community oversight
- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Leveraging collective judgment
- **Error Correction**: Democratic mechanisms for correcting mistakes

## Novel Security Challenges

### Democratic Attack Vectors

Democratic governance introduces new attack surfaces:

#### Social Engineering Attacks
- **Influence Campaigns**: Manipulation of community opinion
- **False Grassroots**: Artificial community support (astroturfing)
- **Information Warfare**: Coordinated disinformation campaigns
- **Identity Manipulation**: Creating false community personas

#### Governance Attacks
- **Vote Buying**: Purchasing community support for validators
- **Collusion Networks**: Coordinated behavior among validators
- **Regulatory Capture**: Influence through legal/regulatory pressure

#### Constitutional Attacks
- **Amendment Manipulation**: Subverting constitutional change processes
- **Emergency Exploitation**: Abusing crisis protocols for permanent changes
- **Interpretation Attacks**: Manipulating constitutional interpretation
- **Precedent Corruption**: Establishing harmful governance precedents

### Research Challenges

#### Quantifying Democratic Security
- **Legitimacy Metrics**: How to measure community support objectively
- **Representation Quality**: Assessing quality of democratic representation
- **Participation Rates**: Impact of low participation on security
- **Cultural Validity**: Security across different cultural contexts

#### Formal Verification Challenges
- **Democratic Properties**: Proving democratic guarantees cryptographically
- **Social Dynamics**: Modeling human behavior in security proofs
- **Long-term Evolution**: Security properties over time
- **Cross-cultural Applicability**: Universal vs. context-specific security

## Threat Model

### Threat Actors

#### External Adversaries
- **Nation-State Actors**: Government attempts to control or disrupt network
- **Criminal Organizations**: Profit-motivated attacks on network security

### Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Democratic Capture
**Objective**: Control network through democratic processes
**Method**:
1. Create false community support through sock puppet accounts
2. Get malicious validators elected through manipulated voting
3. Gradually change consensus rules through democratic amendments
4. Establish permanent control while maintaining democratic appearance

**Mitigations**:
- Identity verification for community participation
- Geographic and demographic validation of support
- Constitutional limits on amendment scope
- Multi-stakeholder approval requirements

#### Scenario 2: Emergency Exploitation
**Objective**: Use crisis to bypass democratic controls
**Method**:
1. Create or exploit network crisis requiring emergency response
2. Activate emergency protocols that concentrate power
3. Make permanent changes while emergency protocols active
4. Resist return to normal democratic operations

**Mitigations**:
- Strict time limits on emergency powers
- Automatic sunset clauses for emergency measures
- Independent oversight during emergency periods
- Constitutional review of all emergency actions

#### Scenario 3: Gradual Erosion
**Objective**: Slowly undermine democratic institutions
**Method**:
1. Make small changes that individually seem reasonable
2. Gradually shift power from community to validators
3. Establish precedents that weaken democratic oversight
4. Create irreversible changes to governance structure

**Mitigations**:
- Constitutional protections for fundamental rights
- Transparency requirements for all governance changes
- Regular constitutional review processes
- Community education on democratic principles

### Attack Resistance Analysis

#### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Traditional BFT assumptions with democratic enhancements:

- **Classic BFT**: f < n/3 for safety and liveness
- **Democratic Enhancement**: Additional legitimacy requirements
- **Geographic BFT**: No single jurisdiction controls >33% validators
