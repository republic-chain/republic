# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Republic blockchain and constitutional governance.

## General Questions

### What is Republic blockchain?

Republic is a Layer 3 blockchain that implements democratic governance principles inspired by constitutional frameworks, particularly the Constitution of India. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that rely on computational power (Proof of Work) or economic stake (Proof of Stake), Republic uses **Constitutional Consensus** - where governance principles from democratic institutions are embedded directly into the protocol layer.

### How is Republic different from other blockchains?

Republic introduces several novel concepts:

- **Democratic Consensus**: Validators are selected through community representation, not just economic stake
- **Constitutional Framework**: Immutable governance rules with formal amendment procedures
- **Term Limits**: Mandatory rotation of validators to prevent power concentration
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Regular evaluation and potential removal of underperforming validators
- **Proportional Representation**: Multiple factors beyond wealth determine participation

### What does "constitutional blockchain" mean?

A constitutional blockchain embeds democratic governance principles directly into the protocol layer, similar to how political constitutions establish the framework for government. This includes:

- Separation of powers between different network roles
- Checks and balances to prevent abuse of power
- Formal procedures for making changes to the system
- Protection of participant rights and responsibilities
- Transparent and accountable decision-making processes

### Why is Republic called a "Layer 3" blockchain?

Republic is positioned as Layer 3 because it builds upon existing blockchain infrastructure (Layer 1) and scaling solutions (Layer 2) to add a governance layer that implements constitutional democratic principles. It leverages proven foundations while introducing innovative governance mechanisms.

## Technical Questions

### What consensus mechanism does Republic use?

Republic uses **Democratic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT)**, a novel consensus mechanism that extends traditional BFT with democratic principles:

- Validators are selected through community representation, not just stake
- Leadership rotates based on term limits and democratic evaluation
- Consensus requires both technical agreement (2f+1 signatures) and democratic legitimacy
- Additional quorum requirements ensure geographic and stakeholder diversity

### What programming language is Republic built in?

Republic is implemented in **Rust**, chosen for its:
- Memory safety and performance characteristics
- Strong ecosystem for blockchain development
- Excellent support for concurrent and distributed systems
- Active community and comprehensive tooling

### Does Republic use an account-based or UTXO model?

**This is currently being researched and decided**. The current experimental code implements an account-based model similar to Ethereum, but the final decision will be made during Phase 0 (Design & Specification) based on:
- Compatibility with democratic governance features
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Developer experience and ecosystem considerations
- Community input and feedback

### How does Republic handle smart contracts?

Republic will support smart contracts through:
- **Phase 1**: Basic built-in operations (TRANSFER, CALL, SET_STORAGE, GET_STORAGE)
- **Phase 3+**: Full WASM-based smart contract runtime
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All contracts must operate within constitutional bounds
- **Democratic Oversight**: Governance mechanisms for contract standards and regulations

### What are the system requirements for running a Republic node?

**Minimum Requirements**:
- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GB
- Storage: 20 GB available space
- Network: Stable broadband connection

**Recommended for Validators**:
- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: 8+ GB
- Storage: 100+ GB SSD
- Network: Low-latency broadband with backup connectivity

## Governance Questions

### How are validators selected in Republic?

Validator selection considers multiple factors in a weighted algorithm:
- **Economic Stake** (25%): Commitment to network security
- **Technical Reputation** (25%): Proven infrastructure and security record
- **Geographic Distribution** (20%): Ensuring global representation
- **Community Support** (20%): Endorsements from network participants
- **Diversity Metrics** (10%): Promoting inclusive participation

### What happens if validators misbehave?

Republic implements several accountability mechanisms:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of validator performance
- **Community Evaluation**: Regular assessment by stakeholders
- **Slashing**: Economic penalties for provable misbehavior
- **Removal Procedures**: Democratic processes for removing underperforming validators
- **Appeal Rights**: Fair processes for disputed decisions

### How can the protocol be upgraded?

Protocol upgrades follow a formal constitutional amendment process:
1. **Proposal**: Community member submits formal proposal
2. **Review**: Technical and constitutional assessment
3. **Public Comment**: Open discussion period
4. **Representative Vote**: Super-majority approval required
5. **Staged Implementation**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

### What rights do network participants have?

Republic's constitutional framework guarantees:
- **Participation Rights**: Fair access to governance processes
- **Transparency Rights**: Access to decision-making information
- **Appeal Rights**: Mechanisms to challenge validator decisions
- **Representation Rights**: Voice in validator selection and governance
- **Privacy Rights**: Protection of personal information and transactions

## Development Questions

### Is there a Republic token?

No token currently exists. Tokenomics design is part of Phase 0 research and will be developed with community input. Any future token will be designed to support democratic governance rather than pure economic speculation.

## Governance and Economics

### How does Republic prevent wealth-based oligarchy?

Several mechanisms prevent plutocracy:
- **Multi-factor Validator Selection**: Wealth is only one factor (25%) in validator selection
- **Term Limits**: Mandatory rotation prevents entrenchment

- **Community Oversight**: Democratic accountability mechanisms
- **Constitutional Limits**: Caps on individual influence and power

### What is the role of community governance?

Community governance in Republic includes:
- **Validator Selection**: Community input on validator candidates
