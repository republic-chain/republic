# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the Republic blockchain community! We're excited to have you contribute to building the future of democratic blockchain governance.

!!! info "Development Phase"
    Republic is currently in Phase 0 (Design & Specification). Most contributions at this stage involve research, documentation, and specification work rather than code implementation.
